- Question
Provide up to 3 links to examples of product developer documentation pages that inspire you and explain in a few words why you think they are worth mentioning.

1. https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/
2. https://ramdajs.com/docs/#
3. https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

I have preference for documentation which are easy enought to find what you want - and not sit too much. 
For example I have always quite the trouble with Mongoose's documentation, thus I just use StackOverflow.

Reacts documentation is good because it's also welcoming for newcommers and has many various patterns.

Given the following dataset and query:
Data: The geographical location of 1 million users, updated roughly every half hour;
Every record has a userid, time, place name, address, latitude, longitude, location accuracy in meters and previous location.

Query: find all users currently within 150m radius of a location N, which has a latitude and longitude.

Explain what would be an efficient way to store the data and how you would query it. 
Make sure to name a database system that would handle the storage and explain why you selected it

- Answer
I would look to Google S2, which provides the availability to disperse longitude / latitude coordinates by cells in a maps 
spherical representation - where each cell has a uniqueId. By drawing the circle range it would be able 
to get all cell id's of a range and get all the ranges data.

I would choose MongoDB and if there is a lot of data, look how I can partition the dataset.
